## Review Item View
### Interface
When the user fires the action "Review the item" in the Display Item View, a modal window for reviewing shows up. It contains:
- Three confidence level buttons
	- ðŸŸ¢ Confident: review in XX days (e.g., review in 7 days)
	- ðŸ”µ Medium: review in YY days (e.g., review in 3 days)
	- ðŸ”´ WTF: review in ZZ days (e.g., review in 1 day)
- Custom date: in addition to the user-configured review interval based on the three confidence levels, the user can also type desired dates (XX days later) to decide when to review the item next.
- Archive the item: the item will be archived. It won't show up again in the Display Item View.
