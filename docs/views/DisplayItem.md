## Display Item View

### Grid Organization
- Items flow **left to right** in rows within each category
- Multiple items can appear on the same row
- Cards have **consistent width** (110px) but **flexible height** based on content
- Cards have a **minimum height** (100px) and expand vertically as needed
- **Category height** matches the tallest card in that category
- All cards within a category align to the same top baseline
- When items in a category cannot be displayed at once, there will appear a horizontal scrollable bar.

### Shortcuts
- Cmd+N: New item
- Cmd+Edit: Edit the item
- Cmd+space: Review the item
- Cmd+L: Review the item
- Double click: Review the item

### Card Content Layout
Each card displays:
1. **Item Name** - Bold title with automatic text wrapping (e.g., "Derivatives", "Ephemeral")
2. **Problem Content** - Full problem text with automatic word wrapping
3. **Media Indicators** - Visual buttons for additional content (if present):

**Content Behavior:**
- Text automatically wraps within card boundaries
- Cards expand vertically to accommodate longer content
- All content remains contained within card borders
- No text truncation - full content is always visible

### Content Types Displayed

**Problem Content** (shown on cards):
- **Text**: Displayed in full with automatic word wrapping
- **URLs**: Shown as clickable link buttons
- **Images**: Displayed as "show the image" buttons (for data efficiency)

**Answer Content** (hidden until requested):
- Accessed via "Show Answer" button
- Opens in separate interface
- Can contain text, URLs, and/or images

### Sorting Logic

#### Primary Sort: Review Status

1. **Unreviewed items first** - These need immediate attention
2. **Reviewed items second** - Available for reference but deprioritized

#### Secondary Sort: Temporal

Within each review status, items are sorted by:
- Created date or last accessed time
- Most recent items appear last

### Sidebar Information

**Quick Stats panel** provides:
- **Finished** - unreviewed item count/total item count (e.g., 12/20)
