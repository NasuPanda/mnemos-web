## Display Item View

### Grid Organization
- Items flow **left to right** in rows within each category
- Multiple items can appear on the same row
- Cards are **uniformly sized** for visual consistency
- When items in a category cannot be displayed at once, there will appear a horizontal scrollable bar.

- Cmd+Edit: Edit the item
- Cmd+space: Review the item
- Cmd+L: Review the item

Each card displays:
1. **Item Name** - Bold title (e.g., "Derivatives", "Ephemeral")
2. **Problem Preview** - Shows snippet of the actual problem content

### Content Types Displayed

**Problem Content** (shown on cards):
- **Text**: Displayed as-is (full content)
- **URLs**: Shown as clickable link buttons
- **Images**: Displayed as "show the image" buttons (for data efficiency)

**Answer Content** (hidden until requested):

### Sorting Logic

#### Primary Sort: Review Status

1. **Unreviewed items first** - These need immediate attention
2. **Reviewed items second** - Available for reference but deprioritized

#### Secondary Sort: Temporal

Within each review status, items are sorted by:
- Created date or last accessed time
- Most recent items appear last

### Sidebar Information

**Quick Stats panel** provides:
- **Finished** - unreviewed item count/total item count (e.g., 12/20)
